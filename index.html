			<h3>About Up-Lighting</h3>
				<p>LISTEN TO WHAT THE INDUSTRY EXPERTS ARE SAYING: "Without question, one of the hottest trends in event design is the use of decorative lighting. Lighting can create some beauty in an otherwise bland or unremarkable ballroom, or it can accentuate the features of an attractive ballroom. Each person renting an event space has a different vision of how they want it to look for their event, and incorporating lighting into the design scheme is a very effective and dramatic way to achieve that vision. Furthermore, the visual aesthetics work in tandem with the subtle psychological impact of colored light to evoke an emotional responce from the guests. For example, you can make people feel cooler with the use of blues and greens; and you can make them feel warmer by using reds, oranges, and ambers. The extraordinary impact goes beyond just the visual!" </p>
