			<h2>About Up-Lighting</h2>
				<h3>Listen to what the industry experts are saying:</h3>
		 		<p>"Without question, one of the hottest trends in event design is the use of decorative lighting. Lighting can create some beauty in an otherwise bland or unremarkable ballroom, or it can accentuate the features of an attractive ballroom. Each person renting an event space has a different vision of how they want it to look for their event, and incorporating lighting into the design scheme is a very effective and dramatic way to achieve that vision. Furthermore, the visual aesthetics work in tandem with the subtle psychological impact of colored light to evoke an emotional responce from the guests. For example, you can make people feel cooler with the use of blues and greens; and you can make them feel warmer by using reds, oranges, and ambers. The extraordinary impact goes beyond just the visual!" </p>

			<h2>About</h2>	
				<p>The New Dance Machine is owned and operated by Shaun Gehrke, an area DJ with over <em>10 years experience</em>. He is known for his flawless mixing, and MC ability. With his club experience spinning records, as well as an appearance at The Detroit Electronic Music Festival, he has moved on to bring his mixing skills to a wider audience. Along with mixing beats, now transitioning all genres of music together to satisfy the masses, makes him the perfect wedding DJ. Being able to feel out the crowd and get them not only on the dance floor, but to keep them there, sets him apart from others.
	

				<p>Our vast library of over 70,000 songs, can assure you that music in every genre will be covered with crisp, clear sound. From digitally remastered oldies, to today's top hits, we have them all. Using only music purchased through reputable sites like iTunes and Rhapsody, we are able to have this library with every song on the Billboard top 100 from 1958 to today. If by chance there is a track we do not have in our library, on the spot download capabilities takes care of that (as long as the venue has wi-fi, and the song is available through iTunes, or Rhapsody). Having this ability takes our shows to an all new level, being able to play for even the most diverse crowds. Keeping these tracks on muliple computers, external drives, and cd backups, makes our systems the most reliable in the industry.</p>

				<p>Our mission is to make a memorable experience at every event we DJ. Providing a fun and comfortable atmosphere for all guests. From weddings to school functions, we pride ourselves on understanding the needs of each event, tailoring every performance to the venue and client.</p>
